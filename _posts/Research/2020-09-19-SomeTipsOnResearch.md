[Key points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7sVKJPTMA&ab_channel=SurvivingandThrivinginHigherEducation)
    1. don't procrastinate;
    2. review the notes and renew the literature search;
    3. determine who your audience is - most likely reviewers, so get their concerns firstly addressed;
    4. create the outline and get the big picture done, i.e., complete the first draft while resisting the temptation to correct and edit as you go; the logical sequence of data/tables/figures may be the outline; while writing the first draft, take notes indicating what references might be needed and would be about, but don't stop to collect the references;
    5. begin with the easier part of the task - experimental section rather then the introduction; then follows the results and discussion section;
    6. then comes the really hard part - critical editing where you make sure that the English is coherent and the science is correct; 
    7. write the conclusion in a numbered format;
    8. then comes the abstract and the acknowledgements;
    9. now comes the introduction, the two most important things to address in which are the purpose and relevant background;
    10. then collect the references.

    Some final notes:
    1. always check the manuscript requirements for the journal of interests.
    2. a few references on writing. Please refer to the video.

    5. Add introduction and conclusion paragraphs to complete the literature review

The literature review does not have to be a daunting or mysterious academic assignment. As a matter of fact, the so-called "literature review" is a common task in the professional workplace but is called a "backgrounder" or "background research" instead of a literature review. The video provides a real-world example of writing a practical literature review as an HR employee in an IT company.
