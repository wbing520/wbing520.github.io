## Basic interview questions about the Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

1. What is Class and Object?
   Class: User defined data type including the data fields and methods.
   Object: Instance of class.

2. What is OOP?
   It is a programming paradigm that represents as "Objects" that have data fields and methods.
3. What is the characters of OOD
    **Encapsulation**: means that the data and the actions are combined into a class object, and the details of the implementation are hidden.

    **Inheritance**: means the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as derived new classes from existing ones such as base class and then forming them into hierarchy of classes.

    **Polymorphism**: "A state of having many shapes" or "the capacity to take on different forms". In OOP, it means a language's ability to process objects of various types and classes through a single, uniform interface. It has two types: Compile time polymorphism(static binding) and Runtime time polymorphism(dynamic binding). Method overloading is an example of static polymorphism, while method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.

1. What is the difference bewteen Composition and Inheritance?
2. What is the difference between Overriding vs Overloading?
    **overloading**: within one class, two or more definition of a single method name but different signatures.
    **overriding**: when the method in derived class inherited from base class will be changed.
3. Difference between interface vs abstract?
   
4. What is SOLID?
5. What is independent injection?
6. What is design pattern?
